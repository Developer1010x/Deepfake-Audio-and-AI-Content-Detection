# Deepfake Audio Detection and AI Text Analysis

## Overview

This Flask application provides a web interface for deepfake audio detection and AI text analysis. Users can upload audio files to detect deepfake content and submit text for analysis to determine if it was generated by AI.

## Features

- **Deepfake Audio Detection**: Upload audio files (wav, mp3, flac) to detect if they are deepfake.
- **AI Text Analysis**: Analyze text to predict if it was generated by AI.
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: Switch between dark and light modes for better user experience.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI with clear instructions and feedback.



### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Flask
- TensorFlow (for Keras model)
- PyTorch and Transformers (for BERT model)
- Librosa (for audio processing)
- Other Python packages specified in `requirements.txt`
